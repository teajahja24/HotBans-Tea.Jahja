            <td style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px;">Working with an incredibly diverse range of projects and a highly skilled, dedicated and passionate team. It’s an absolute pleasure to be involved with such a skilled bunch. I also love that no two days are the same, even after a decade in my role I’m continually challenged in an ever-evolving world of technology.</td>

She also provides a supporting role in new project work and deals with support requests.  A background in accountancy and finance mean Amy has attention to detail and experience working closely with clients who have very specific technical requirements.  She has a passion for numbers, data and patterns, and has found that working with code is endlessly fascinating, with something new to learn every day.  Working in accountancy has also taught Amy adherence to a raft of ever changing legislation and guidance, which is in line with the strict compliance standards HotBeans are proud to uphold. </td>
